      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! When input is LOW, PMOS is ON (conducting), NMOS is OFF (non-conducting), and the output is connected to VDD (HIGH).",
        "b": "This is what happens when the input is HIGH, not LOW.",
        "c": "In a properly designed CMOS inverter, PMOS and NMOS are never both ON simultaneously during static operation.",
