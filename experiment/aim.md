This experiment aims to:
1. Design and simulate a transistor-level CMOS inverter circuit using SPICE
2. Understand the behavior of NMOS and PMOS transistors in digital logic
3. Analyze the voltage transfer characteristic (VTC) of a CMOS inverter
4. Learn how to create and analyze SPICE netlists for basic digital circuits
