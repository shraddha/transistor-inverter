      "question": "What is the typical ratio of PMOS to NMOS width (Wp/Wn) in a CMOS inverter to achieve symmetric VTC?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "1:1",
        "b": "2:1",

        "d": "4:1"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A 1:1 ratio would result in an asymmetric VTC because PMOS has lower carrier mobility than NMOS.",
        "b": "Correct! A 2:1 ratio (PMOS width to NMOS width) is typically used to compensate for the lower hole mobility in PMOS compared to electron mobility in NMOS.",
        "c": "This ratio is higher than typically needed for most processes.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Supply voltage (VDD) directly affects both dynamic and static power consumption. P = CV²f for dynamic power.",
        "b": "Switching frequency directly affects dynamic power consumption. P = CV²f.",
        "c": "Load capacitance directly affects dynamic power consumption. P = CV²f.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct! MOSFET devices in SPICE are defined with 'M' followed by the device number, then the drain, gate, source, and bulk nodes, followed by the model name and parameters.",

        "a": "While transistor resistance contributes to delay, it's not the primary cause.",
        "b": "Correct! The primary cause of propagation delay is the time required to charge and discharge the load capacitance through the MOS transistors.",
        "c": "Carrier recombination is not a significant factor in CMOS propagation delay.",

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Transient analysis is used for time-domain behavior, not for calculating static parameters like noise margins.",
        "b": "Correct! DC sweep analysis is used to generate the VTC curve from which noise margins (NML and NMH) are calculated.",
        "c": "AC analysis is used for small-signal frequency response, not for calculating static parameters like noise margins.",

      "question": "What would be the effect of decreasing the PMOS width in a CMOS inverter while keeping the NMOS width constant?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The switching threshold would shift higher (toward VDD)",

        "c": "The switching threshold would remain unchanged",
        "d": "The inverter would stop functioning completely"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This is incorrect. Decreasing PMOS width reduces its current drive capability, making it harder to pull the output HIGH.",
        "b": "Correct! Decreasing the PMOS width reduces its current drive capability relative to the NMOS. This shifts the switching threshold lower (toward GND) because the NMOS becomes relatively stronger.",
        "c": "The switching threshold is affected by the relative strength of PMOS and NMOS, so it would change when PMOS width is reduced.",
        "d": "The inverter would still function, just with modified characteristics, not complete failure."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "This would only be true if PMOS and NMOS had equal mobility, which they don't.",
        "b": "Correct! Due to lower hole mobility in PMOS compared to electron mobility in NMOS, rise time is typically longer than fall time when transistor widths are equal.",
        "c": "This is incorrect. PMOS has lower mobility than NMOS, so rise time is longer.",
